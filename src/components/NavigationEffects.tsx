/**
 * NavigationEffects Component
 * 
 * A custom hook and component for managing page transition effects
 * and navigation animations. Demonstrates advanced React patterns
 * and animation techniques.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. Custom Hooks
 * 2. Route Transitions
 * 3. Animation States
 * 4. Event Management
 * 5. Performance Optimization
 * 
 * Learning Exercises:
 * 
 * Exercise 1 - Hook Implementation:
 * - How is the navigation state tracked?
 * - What triggers effect changes?
 * - Study cleanup patterns
 * 
 * Exercise 2 - Animation Logic:
 * - Analyze transition timing
 * - Understand animation sequences
 * - Study effect coordination
 * 
 * Exercise 3 - Route Management:
 * - How are routes monitored?
 * - What triggers transitions?
 * - Study history manipulation
 * 
 * Exercise 4 - Performance:
 * - Identify optimization points
 * - Study render efficiency
 * - Analyze event handling

 * 3. Animation states
 * 4. Navigation events
 * 
 * Learning Challenge:
 * - Add page exit animations
 * - Implement route-specific effects
 * - Create custom transitions
